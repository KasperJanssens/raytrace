A simple raytracer
==================

# Source files

  - src/Talk.hs: the source code used during the talk I gave at the Leuven
    Haskell Users' Group
  - src/Main.hs: the source code of the more extensive engine.

# Features

  - rectangles
  - triangles
  - upright cylinders
  - cuboids
  - diffuse and specular lighting

# Compiling & Installing

This project provides a .cabal file, so building is exceedingly easy:

$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal build

# Usage

The raytracer always writes its output to trace.bmp. 
Change the world and lights variables in the main function to select the
scene you want to render, then run:

$ cabal run; open trace.bmp

This will run the raytracer and then open the trace.bmp file.
To use multiple cores, it is suggested that you use:

$ cabal run -- +RTS -N4; open trace.bmp

This tells the Haskell Runtime System to use multiple core (4 here).
